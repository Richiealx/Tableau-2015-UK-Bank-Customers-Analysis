Project Title: 2015 UK Bank Customers Analysis

The tool used: Tableau

Datasets Source: Quantum Analytics NG

Data Visualization Insights
A total of 4,014 customers had their data used to perform data visualization analysis across the four regions of the UK in 2015.

Customers By Region
The pie chart highlights the disparity in customer balance percentages among the four regions of the UK. England has the largest share, followed by Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. This analysis provides insight into the distribution of customer balances across the regions, indicating varying levels of financial activity and customer base size in each region.
The data reveals that Northern Ireland has the smallest percentage of customer balances, accounting for 5% of the total. This indicates that customer balances in Northern Ireland are relatively lower compared to the other three regions. It could suggest a smaller customer base or a lower average account balance in this region.

Balance Trend By Month

1. May, August, September, October, November, and December: These months have the highest customer balances, ranging from 16,847,598 to 22,767,097 pounds. September has the highest customer balance, followed closely by October, November, and December. This suggests that these months witnessed higher customer savings or larger account balances.
2. April and July: These months have moderate customer balances, with values of 8,148,493 and 16,303,082 pounds, respectively. While not as high as the peak months, they still indicate a significant level of customer savings or account balances.
January, February, March, and June: These months have relatively lower customer balances, ranging from 1,205,743 to 11,258,576 pounds. This implies that these months had lower customer savings or smaller account balances compared to the other months.

Customers By Job Classification

The doughnut chart provides insights into the distribution of customers across different job classifications in the UK. It indicates that the majority of customers are in white-collar jobs, followed by blue-collar jobs, with a smaller proportion falling into other job classifications. This analysis highlights the diversity of the bank's customer base in terms of employment types and can inform strategies for targeting and serving specific customer segments within the UK market.

Customers By Age Band

1.	Adults: The chart indicates that adults have the highest number of customers, with 1,865 individuals. This suggests that the bank's customer base in the UK is primarily composed of individuals in the adult age range, typically referring to individuals between the ages of 25 and 64. This age group is often associated with individuals in their prime working years, with more established financial needs and responsibilities.
2.	Young Adults: The data shows that young adults have the second-highest number of customers, with 1,465 individuals. This category likely includes individuals in the age range of 18 to 24, typically encompassing students, recent graduates, and early-career professionals. Young adults often have unique financial needs and may require specific banking services tailored to their life stage.
3.	Seniors: The chart reveals that seniors have the smallest number of customers, with 630 individuals. This category likely includes individuals aged 65 and above, who are often retired or approaching retirement age. Seniors may have specific financial considerations, such as retirement savings, estate planning, and pension management.
Overall, the chart provides insights into the distribution of customers across different age bands in the UK. It indicates that the majority of customers fall into the adult category, followed by young adults and a smaller proportion represented by seniors. This analysis can help the bank understand the demographic composition of its customer base and tailor its products and services to meet the specific needs and preferences of each age group
